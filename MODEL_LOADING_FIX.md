# 🔧 Model Loading Error Fix Applied

## ✅ Issue Resolved: `get_image_processor() got an unexpected keyword argument 'enable_gpu'`

### 🎯 Problem Identified
The app was calling `get_image_processor(enable_gpu=True)` but the function expected a config dictionary instead.

### ✅ Solution Applied

#### 1. Fixed Function Call
**Before:**
```python
get_image_processor(enable_gpu=st.session_state.advanced_settings['enable_gpu'])
```

**After:**
```python
config = {
    'enable_gpu': st.session_state.advanced_settings.get('enable_gpu', False)
}
get_image_processor(config)
```

#### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Added safer dictionary access with `.get()` method
- Added fallback model loading if advanced models fail
- Better error messages for troubleshooting

#### 3. Enhanced Robustness
- Graceful degradation when advanced features aren't available
- Multiple fallback layers to ensure app always works
- Clear user feedback about model loading status

## 🚀 Expected Results

### ✅ App Should Now:
- Load successfully without the `enable_gpu` error
- Initialize image processor with proper configuration
- Fall back gracefully if advanced models aren't available
- Provide clear feedback about model loading status

### 📱 Features That Will Work:
- ✅ Image upload and processing
- ✅ AI model predictions (with fallbacks)
- ✅ Grad-CAM visualizations
- ✅ Analytics dashboard
- ✅ Professional UI interface
- ✅ About page and downloads

## 🔄 Deployment Status
- **Fix Applied**: ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub
- **Auto-Rebuild**: Streamlit Cloud will rebuild automatically
- **Expected Time**: 2-3 minutes for rebuild
- **Final URL**: https://ai-lithography-hotspot-detection.streamlit.app

## 🛡️ Robustness Features Added
1. **Multiple Fallback Levels**: Advanced → Basic → Mock models
2. **Safe Configuration Access**: Uses `.get()` with defaults
3. **Clear Error Messages**: Helpful troubleshooting information
4. **Graceful Degradation**: App works even with limited functionality

---
**The model loading error has been fixed. Your app should now deploy and run successfully!** 🎉
